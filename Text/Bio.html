<p>  Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods
in the Social Sciences program. I worked for many years as an editor for
Natural History magazine and for Forbes, and my writing has appeared in Discover,
Forbes, AARP the Magazine, and other magazines. I've edited articles on
everything from slime mold to multiple universes, and wrote an eight-page
article for Discover on everybody's favorite particle, the neutrino. My cover
stories for Forbes were featured on National Public Radio, where all my "ums"
were edited out. Previously I was an analyst for Morningstar, and before
that I earned an MA in English literature. On the side, I am working on a
dual scientific biography that combines words and images, and that explores
the politics of memory.</p>
