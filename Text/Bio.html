<p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.5em; padding-right: 3.5em">Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia. I worked for many years as a senior editor for <i>Natural History</i> magazine where I developed and edited stories by scientists, conceptualized the visual components of articles, and reviewed books. My focus was mainly evolutionary biology and physics: everything from the altruism of slime mold and the play of meerkats to the physics of multiple universes. In courses in the EEEB program at Columbia, I enjoyed studying the behavior and socioecology of the living primates, and conducting an observational study of captive capuchin monkeys. 

<p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.5em; padding-right: 3.5em">My writing has appeared in <i>Forbes</i> (where I was an editor before coming to NH), <i>Discover</i>, <i>AARP The Magazine</i>, and others. <a href=http://discovermagazine.com/2014/sept/9-ghosts-of-the-universe>Here's</a> an eight-page article I wrote for <i>Discover</i> about my favorite ghostly particle, the neutrino. Previously I was a bond fund analyst for <a href=http://www.morningstar.com/>Morningstar</a>, and before that I earned a Masters degree in English literature. Among my favorite authors are Alice Munro (devastating), Richard Adams (endearing), George Orwell (terrifying), and the poet Elizabeh Bishop (one of her brilliant sestinas can be found <a href=https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-miracle-for-breakfast/>here</a>).</p>

 <p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.5em;  padding-right: 3.5em">As a side project,
I am working on a dual scientific biography set at the dawn of
the nuclear age that combines words and images, and that explores the politics of memory. The painting of the beginning of time(s) on the home page is from my book. My cartoons and illustrations have appeared in <i>Natural History</i> and <i>Commonweal</i>.
