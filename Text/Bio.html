<p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.5em; padding-right: 3.5em">Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia. I worked for many years as an editor for Natural History magazine and before that for Forbes, and my writing has appeared in Discover,
Forbes, AARP the Magazine, and others. I've edited articles on
everything from the altruism of slime mold to the physics of multiple universes, and wrote an eight-page
article for Discover on everybody's favorite ghostly particle, the neutrino. I studied primate social structure and behavior, among other things, in an evolutionary biology certificate program at Columbia. Previously I was an analyst for Morningstar, and before that I earned a Masters degree in English literature. </p>

 <p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.5em;  padding-right: 3.5em">As a side project,
I am working on a dual scientific biography set at the dawn of
the nuclear age that combines words and images, and that explores the politics of memory.
My cartoons and illustrations have appeared in Natural History and Commonweal.</p>
