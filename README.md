# WebFolder: Contains files for website created for data visualization course

Assignments featured on the website include a weather app that uses an API to get the current weather from any city entered by the user, and plays an appropriate animation and song depending on the particular weather conditions.

For example, if the user enters "New York" and it is currently raining there, users will see an animation of rain coming down (created in p5.js) accompanied by the song "Singin' in the Rain." Different songs and animations are featured for sunny, cloudy, snowing, raining, and thunder/lightning weather conditions.
