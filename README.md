Assignments include a weather app that plays a different animation accompanied by an appropriate song, depending on the current weather in the entered city. For example, if the user enters "New York" and it is raining there, they will see an animation of rain coming down (created in p5.js) accompaning by the song "Singin' in the Rain." Different songs and animations are featured for sunny, cloudy, raining, and thunder/lightning weather conditions.
