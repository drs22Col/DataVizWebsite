# WebFolder: Contains files for website created for data visualization course

Assignments featured on the website include a musical animated weather app. The user enters the name of a city, and the app  plays an appropriate animation and song depending on the particular current weather conditions in that city.

For example, if the user enters "New York" and it is raining there, users will see an animation of rain coming down (created in p5.js) accompanied by the song "Singin' in the Rain." 

Different songs and animations are featured for sunny, cloudy, snowing, raining, and thunder/lightning weather conditions.
