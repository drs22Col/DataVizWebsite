      <h2><i>The Music and Motion Weather App</i></h2>
    </div>
    <p id= p_indent> Welcome! This app is designed to take advantage of the sound and animation possibilities of p5 libraries. Enter the name of a city, and depending on the current weather there -- sunny, cloudy, snowing, showers or thunderstorms -- you will see an appropriate animation accompanied by a song that is right for the occasion. The music will put you in a better mood, no matter the level of precipitation -- singing in the snow can be just as fun as singin' in the rain!</p> 

    <p id= p_indent> Possible cities to try for different effects: Aomori (gets the most snow in the world), Yuma (in Arizona, and very sunny), Mawsynram (typically rainy), Buffalo (often cloudy), and Kampala (a city in Africa where thunder is heard on average 242 days of the year). 

    <p id= p_indent> If there is no thunderstorm in Kampala today, you can go to http://en.blitzortung.org/live_lightning_maps.php for a live lightning map, and then choose cities in the states or countries where lightning is striking in the hopes of hearing a "thunderous" song.</p> 

    <p id= p_indent> To pause a song, simply click your mouse. Or if it's a favorite, turn up the volume!</p>
