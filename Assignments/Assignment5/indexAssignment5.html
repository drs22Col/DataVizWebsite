  <p style="font-size:24px">In this p5.js version of the earlier boxplot, I decided to make a few changes. The main one is that I switched to a linear scale on the y-axis, which indicates price per square foot. I wanted to emphasize just how much more expensive the outliers (most expensive apts) were compared to the majority of the highest-priced buildings in their neighborhoods. These outliers are all above 1.5 times the Interquartile Ranges for each neighborhood. Even in this rarefied, exclusive peer group, some buildings are worth many multiples more. Also, I think reading from a boxplot is not intuitive for most people, and I think it ultimately defeats the purpose of the goal of communicating information clearly to a broader, non-stats oriented audience. 

  <p style="font-size:24px">I also added horizontal grid lines so it is easier to tell what the values are for those outlier dots. For style reasons, I also chose different colors for the bars representing the five neighborhoods; these colors are a fixed amount apart on the color wheel. As before, the black lines in the middle of the bars represent the medians, and the rest is typical of box plot construction, built around interquartile ranges as before.

  <p style="font-size:24px">The problem with this version and using the linear scale, however, is that the values on the bottom are squashed. The canvas would have to be a lot bigger for this to work, and people would have to scroll just to see the whole image. Also, on reconsideration, I decided that the choice of neighborhoods was not rigorous enough, and that it would be better to include a broader range of data in Manhattan. As a result, I decided to reconceptualize this assignment, which you can see when you click on Assessed Value by Zip Code on the Home page. </p>
