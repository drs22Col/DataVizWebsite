  <p style="font-size:24px">In this p5.js version of the earlier boxplot, I decided to make a few changes. The main one is that I switched to a linear scale on the y-axis, which indicates price per square foot. I wanted to emphasize just how much more expensive the outliers (most expensive apts) were compared to the majority of the highest-priced buildings in their  neighborhoods. Even in this rarefied, exclusive peer group, some buildings are worth many multiples more. I also added horizontal grid lines so it is easier to tell what the values are for the dots, which represent the outliers. These outliers are all above 1.5 times the Interquartile Range. For style reasons, I also chose different colors, spaced apart a consistent amount on the color wheel, for the bars representing the five neighborhoods. As before, the black lines in the middle of the bars represent the medians; the rest is typical box plot construction, built around interquartile ranges as before. </p>
