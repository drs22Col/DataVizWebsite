  <p style="font-size:24px">In this p5.js version of the earlier boxplot, I decided to make a few changes. The main one is that I switched to a linear scale on the y-axis, which indicates price per square foot. I wanted to emphasize just how much more expensive the outliers (most expensive apts) were compared to the majority of the highest-priced buildings in their neighborhoods. These outliers are all above 1.5 times the Interquartile Ranges for each neighborhood. Even in this rarefied, exclusive peer group, some buildings are worth many multiples more. 

  <p style="font-size:24px">I also added horizontal grid lines so it is easier to tell what the values are for those outlier dots. For style reasons, I also chose different colors for the bars representing the five neighborhoods; these colors are a fixed amount apart on the color wheel. As before, the black lines in the middle of the bars represent the medians, and the rest is typical of box plot construction, built around interquartile ranges as before.

  <p style="font-size:24px">NOTE: I also will be adding an Y axis label and play around with the scale so there is more resolution on the lower numbers. And I am thinking of a few other additions I have sketched out as well that are in the works, and which will set the stage for the interactive version. </p>
