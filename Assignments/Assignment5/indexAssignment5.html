  <p style="font-size:24px">In this p5.js version of the earlier boxplot, I decided to make a few changes. The main one is that I switched to a linear scale on the y-axis, which indicates price per square foot. I wanted to emphasize just how much more expensive the outliers (most expensive apts) were compared to the majority of the highest-priced buildings in their  neighborhoods. Even in this rarefied, exclusive peer group, some buildings are worth many multiples more. For cohesion and style reasons, I also used different colors, spaced apart a consistent amount on the color wheel, for the bars representing the five neighborhoods.</p>
