<a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/01/making-it-big/">''The Unlikely Odds of Making it Big''</a> by Russell Goldenberg and Dan Kopf of ''The Pudding''>

<p> In a column format reminiscent of a magazine article, the ''opening act'' of The Pudding’s ''The Unlikely Odds of Making it Big'' consists, in part, of white text on a dramatic black background, and an anecdotal lede about Sylvan Esso playing at a small NY venue called the Mercury Lounge in 2013. Links to their songs add an Internet dimension from the start.</p>

<a href="CritiqueImages/PIC1_MakingItBig"></a>

<p>Accompanying this standard journalistic lede is an attention-grabbing rotating circle to the right, filled with 3180 swarming dots. These represent all the bands that played a small venue more than once in the NYC area from 2013 - 2016. Positioned in this rotating musical universe, Sylvan Esso is marked with a dot color-coded pink, connected to the same color reference in the text. Focusing on a particular band in the image effectively gives us a relatable point of entry just as the anecdotal lede brings us into the story.</p>

<p>As we press the arrow down to read on, the text scrolls down while the circle image stays in place so we don’t lose sight of it. We are invited to click on a rough YouTube video made by an audience member who watched Sylvan Esso perform at a huge venue a few years after the Mercury Lounge appearance, offering a grungy, visceral snapshot of what ''making it big'' (playing at a 3000 +venue) means. Having thus effectively set the stage, the essay will step back to the main theme of the odds of success.</p>

<p>As we read further, we learn that only 400 of the 7000 bands that played a small venue in 2013 went on to play at a medium-size venue; in an excellent animated move, a new moving smaller circular band comprised of 400 dots, marked ''MEDIUM,'' starts circling within the larger ''SMALL VENUE'' circle. We see the relative numbers of bands easily, and intuitively understand the bullseye structure: the closer to the center, the better off the band and the closer to ''making it.'' Color is again effectively used to link text with image: the green “only 400” in the text links with the 400 green dots in the image.</p>

<p>Finally, as we continue further down the page, new red points dramatically fly into the center of the circle, labelled ''BIG”''to indicate the largest venues. According to Graphical Integrity, the ''special power of graphics is in the display of datasets'' with over 20 data points. As if aware of this magic number, now that we are focusing on the 21 most successful bands, their names appear, highlighted in red. Each is honored with a link to their music and CD cover that is brightly lit as their dot flies in, adding additional graphic interest. And again, the use of sound brings the topic to life.</p>

<p>Now that this lovely three-step bullseye visualization is complete, the essay’s ''first act'' is over: a new section is clearly signaled with inverted colors (black print on white background), titled ''HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE IT.'' Again the authors uses a clean, intuitive layout in their next visualization: a series of lines of varying length for each successful band, arranged in order of how many years until it played a large venue. The red and green color scheme from earlier is carried through: red circles indicate when the band headlined, green when they opened; the bigger the circle the bigger the venue. All is again quickly grasped. Lucius at the top took 5.3 years, whereas Sylvan Esso on the bottom took only 3.0 years.</p>
   
<a href="CritiqueImages/PIC4_SecondVisualization"></a>

<p>While the graphic is well-designed and elegant, here the text stumbles. Again the authors focus on a particular band: ''The long journey to popular success of the indie pop band Lucius is more typical [than Sylvan Esso’s]. The Brooklyn based band played 24 small to medium sized shows in New York from 2009 to 2014, before headlining Terminal Five in December 2014.''  However, to call Lucius more typical than Sylvan Esso is clearly not accurate; as we quickly see from the graphic, Lucius took longer than any other band. They are as much an outlier as Sylvan Esso, which took the least amount of time. (There is no calculation of mean or median, but a quick visual survey indicates that the median is probably about 3 years.)</p>
   
<p>The final, third section ''EVERYBODY ELSE'' is an interactive compendium of the 3,000 bands that played a show in 2013, and at least one more show from 2014 to 2016.  It is searchable by venue or band name. This interactive element expands the life and usefulness of the essay, since readers can check out their favorite bands. But the information here is just limited to the names of the venues and performance dates, and there are no links to music or YouTube videos.</p>
     
<a href="CritiqueImages/PIC5_AlsoRans"></a>
 
<p>In terms of design and narrative flow, the piece is very successful. The color scheme is dramatic and coherent, and supports the information well. The writing is clear and succinct, and moves logically from point to point, carrying the reader along effortlessly. And what stands out even more is the effective melding of visual elements with the narrative: they work together seamlessly, hand in hand. Where the essay’s limitations lie relate to definitions, analysis and depth.</p>

<p>As defined here, ''making it big'' relies on venue size as a proxy for success, which does make sense given the current huge pressure on record sales; it is true that a lot of bands make more of their money from touring.  However, there are some obvious errors that result from this methodology: 10,000 Maniacs is listed in the ''EVERYBODY ELSE'' section even though they are one of the world’s most successful bands. It’s just that they apparently chose to only play a couple small venue in NY years after their heyday. And even if bands play a big venue, that does not mean they have ''made it big'' financially, which belies the authors' claim about Sylan Esso: "There is no doubt they made it big." In fact, because of the difficult current financial realities of the music industry, bands who have played large venues can even be essentially homeless if they don’t have a second job, as explained in<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/30/rocknroll-stardom-live-music-struggling-bands-slow-club-brawlers"> this 2016 article </a>from ''The Guardian.''>

</p>

<p>Further, the definition of ''making it big'' is NY-centric in a way that may be misleading. A country band that is big in Nashville may not attract a big crowd in NY, and thus be considered to have not “made it big.” It might have been worthwhile to offer another level of analysis by incorporating the origins of the bands, whether local to New York, and also whether American or foreign. From the second graphic of the successful bands, we see that some never opened for other bands, and others seem to play rarely, indicating they are probably devoting their energies elsewhere. These are not fatal flaws; it's more that larger context might have been interesting to include.</p>

<p>The piece is really about the rarity of playing a large NY venue during a certain time period, rather than about the odds of success. The latter would start by considering the number of venues of different sizes, and how many acts they book per year. It would also try to model the factors that influence success. This essay does not tell you the probability of success going forward, nor draw any conclusions about the successful bands, nor analyze the causes of success. Are certain genres more likely to be successful? How much do the looks or charisma of the lead singer matter versus songwriting prowess or marketing? What about the role of social media? How do the numbers change over different time periods? Does the name of the band matter? One might imagine exploring these questions and many more were one really interested in the odds of success, or in embracing the complexity behind success. What the current analysis does is give us a snapshot of the rarity of success in a certain time period, which might or might not have been atypical. It is interesting and engaged, but not especially analytically deep.</p>

<p>In ''Data Humanism: The Revolutionary Future of Data Visualization,'' Giorgi Lupi by contrast recommends embracing complexity in the new digital age of design. She argues that clarity should not necessarily be immediately apparently until one delves into the graphics. In ''Making It Big'' all is easily grasped—the clarity is in fact one of the strengths here. The authors still weave in some complexity because there are multiple visualizations embedded in a narrative. Such complexity as there is is thus spread out rather than all compressed into one multilayer graphic design that has cleverly integrated various elements and must be decoded, which is Lupi's approach. Her skill set is packing the complexity into the design itself. The different approaches to complexity probably are a function of the differing backgrounds of the creators:  The Pudding consists of “journalist engineers,” whereas Lupe is a trained designer.</p> 

<p>The advantage of The Pudding’s storytelling approach is it can help combat the danger outlined in ''The Death of Interactivity,'' where complexity is wasted because no one clicks to the next level to get to the complexity. ''Making It Big,'' takes you step-by-step through different views of the data without requiring you to click on anything, and with a narrative that carries you along with ease. Were this a more powerful analytical essay, it would involve sliders and inputs that allow us to see relationships of real probabilities over time, and the effects of various factors on the odds. Instead it is an elegant essay that makes its point clearly and in an exceedingly entertaining way. It imaginatively offers a slice of data iin a way that does shed light on the competiveness of the NY band landscape. It may not dig deep, for ultimately it is simplicity rather than complexity that is embraced here. But the visual verve and efficiency of the designs are to be admired, and one can applaud and enjoy the sheer fun and beauty of this lovely visual essay.</p>
