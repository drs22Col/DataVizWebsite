    <p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.8em; padding-right: 3.8em">Just how pricey are the most expensive apartments on the Upper West Side? Or the West Village? Which neighborhood can boast (or decry) the most expensive building of them all? Based on PLUTO data from NYC.gov, this boxplot reveals the spread in cost per square foot for the 20 highest-valued buildings in five wealthy Manhattan neighborhoods: Gramercy, Soho, the Upper West Side, the Upper East Side, and the West Village.</p>

 <p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.8em; padding-right: 3.8em">The boxplot format makes it easy to compare the range, median, and quartiles by neighborhood. Note the log scale: there is a huge difference between the most and least expensive buildings even among the top 20s represented here. The Upper West Side has the largest range, and also houses the priciest building, marked with a "1". It is worth a whopping $49,697 per square foot.  Gramercy contains the second most expensive butilding, marked with a "2" (valued at $43,700 per square foot). At the bottom of the pack, the most expensive building in Soho is a mere $7,393 per square foot. </p>

<p style="font-size:24px;padding-left: 3.8em; padding-right: 3.8em"> What is the identity of that #1 uber-expensive building on the Upper West Side? On 72nd Street, Yoko Ono continues to live in the famous Dakota building where John Lennon once lived with her as well. Could that be it? Looking over the PLUTO data more carefully, it turns out that 72nd Street is left out all together, as are some other streets. The Dakota may well be the real #1 that was left out from this boxplot. Unfortunately, one's charts are ultimately only as complete as the data on which they are based. </p>
