    <p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.8em; padding-right: 3.8em">Just how pricey are the most expensive apartments on the Upper West Side? Or the West Village? Which neighborhood can boast (or decry) the most expensive building of them all? Based on PLUTO data from NYC.gov, here are two data visualizations that examine that question and look at relative values in five wealthy Manhattan neighborhoods: Gramercy, Soho, the Upper West Side, the Upper East Side, and the West Village. Both images reveal the spread in cost per square foot in the 20 highest-priced buildings, just pictured differently.</p>


 <p style="font-size:24px; padding-left: 3.8em; padding-right: 3.8em">In the first to the left, the boxplot format makes it easy to compare the range, median, and quartiles by neighborhood. Note the log scale: there is a huge difference between the most and least expensive buildings even among the top 20s represented here. The Upper West Side has the largest range, and also houses the priciest building, marked with a "1". It is worth a whopping $49,697 per square foot. Gramercy contains the second most expensive butilding, marked with a "2" (valued at $43,700 per square foot). At the bottom of the pack, the most expensive building in Soho is a mere $7,393 per square foot. </p>

<p style="font-size:24px;padding-left: 3.8em; padding-right: 3.8em"> What is the identity of that #1 uber-expensive building on the Upper West Side? We will find out in the interactive version of this chart in a future assignment! In the meantime, the image on the right is another way of visualizing the same data that suggests buildings: this second visualization, quickly generated in Excel once the numbers were calculated and after several experiments, will inform one of my future re-designs in a later p5 assignment.</p>
